      {
        question: "What are the benefits of having a booking app for my business?",
        answer: "A booking app allows customers to make reservations independently <strong>anytime, including outside business hours</strong>. This reduces admin workload, minimizes recording errors, and provides a more professional experience for your customers."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does it take to build a booking app?",
        answer: "Typically it takes <strong>2-4 weeks</strong>, depending on the complexity of features required. The more complete the information provided upfront, the faster the development process."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need technical skills to use this system?",

        question: "How do payments from customers work?",

      },
      {
        question: "Is there a warranty after the booking app is completed?",
        answer: "<strong>Yes</strong>. Every project includes 1 month free maintenance for bug fixes. Technical support is also available if you experience any issues with usage."
